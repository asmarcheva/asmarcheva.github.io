I am a PhD Candidate at Cornell Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management.

I study Environmental and Resource economics, and I'm particularly interested in water management, climate change adaptation, and environmental valuation.  

My job market paper is about how farmers in California use short-term weather forecasts to make irreversible investment into groundwater access through well drilling. I will be on the market in Fall 2025.

My **CV** is [here](./files/CV.pdf). You can reach me at <a href="asm395@cornell.edu">asm395@cornell.edu</a>.
