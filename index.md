I am a PhD Candidate at Cornell Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management.

I study Environmental and Resource economics, and I'm particularly interested in water management, climate change adaptation, and environmental valuation.  

My job market paper will be about how farms learn about and adapt to climate change through choices about water use. I will be on the market in Fall 2025.

My **CV** is [here](./cv.html). You can reach me at <a href="asm395@cornell.edu">asm395@cornell.edu</a>.
